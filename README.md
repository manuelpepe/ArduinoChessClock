# Arduino Chess Clock

This is a PlatformIO project for an Arduino Chess Clock.

Inspired by: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4783782

This is a refactor of the code provided by the original author.

The code has been changed to C++ and rewritten as a library.

You can find the library code in [`lib/ChessClock/src`](https://github.com/manuelpepe/ArduinoChessClock/tree/main/lib/ChessClock/src). The pinout config and main function are defined in [`src/main.cpp`](https://github.com/manuelpepe/ArduinoChessClock/blob/main/src/main.cpp).
